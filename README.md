VCert Python is a Python library and SDK  designed to simplify key generation and enrollment of machine identities
(also known as SSL/TLS certificates and keys) that comply with enterprise security policy by using the
[Venafi Platform](https://www.venafi.com/platform/trust-protection-platform) or [Venafi Cloud](https://pki.venafi.com/venafi-cloud/).

It is a Python copy of original Go library  https://github.com/Venafi/vcert  

For now VCert is supporting only Python 3, we will support Python from 2.6 in future releases.  

## Installation
Get the library using pip:  
`pip3 install vcert`  

You also can install latest version from github:  
`pip3 install https://github
